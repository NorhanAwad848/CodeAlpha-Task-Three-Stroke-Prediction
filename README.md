# CodeAlpha-Task-Three-Stroke-Prediction<br>
Create a model to predict the likelihood of a disease<br>
based on medical data (e.g., symptoms, patient<br>
history). Use datasets with labeled medical records and<br>
apply classification algorithms.<br>
<br>
In this notebook using linear classifiers,such as Logistic Regression,and support vector machines(SVMS)<br>
,and Non-linear classifiers such Random forest and K-nearest neighbors KNN,to potentially improve classification accuracy.<br>
<br>
Model Logistic Regression with accuracy  77.8% <br>
Model SVM with accuracy  97.2%<br>
Model KNN with accuracy   91.16%<br>
Model Random Forest with accuracy   100%<br>
